(Random numbers)
a.A program that simulates the tosses of a coin is as follows:

#define NTOSSES 20
srandom(time(NULL));
int i, count = 0;
for (i=0; i<NTOSSES; i++) {
   int toss = random() % 2;     // toss = 0 or 1
   if (toss == 0) {
      putchar('H');
      count++;
   } else {
      putchar('T');
   }
}
printf("\n%d heads, %d tails\n", count, NTOSSES-count);
Sample output is:
HHTTTTHHTTTHHTHHHHHH
12 heads, 8 tails
1.What would an analogous program to simulate the repeated 
rolling of a die look like?

2.What could be a sample output of this program?

b.If you were given a string, say "hippopotamus",
 and you had to select a random letter, how would you do this?

c.If you have to pick a random number between 2 numbers
, say i and j (inclusive), how would you do this? (Assume i<j.)

Answer:
a.There are 6 outcomes of dice rolling: the numbers 1 to 6.
    * So we'll need a fixed array count[0...5] of length 6 to count how
    many of each
    * This needs to be initialised to all zeros

    We roll the die NROLLS times,just like we tossed the coin.
    * The outcome each time will be roll = 1+random()%6.
    * this is a number between 1 and 6

    We increment the count for this roll:
    count[roll-1]++

    We conclude by printing the contents of the count array.

    The list of digits shows the sequence of the numbers that are rolled.
    The count shows how often each number 1,2,.....6 appeared.

b. We pick a random number between 0 and 11,(as there are 12 letters in the given string,
and they will be stored incides 0 ...11),and then print that element in the character array.

srandom(time(NULL));   
char *string = "hippopotamus";
int size = strlen(string);
int ran = random() %size;
printf("%c\n",string[ran]);

c. We pick a random number between 0 and j-i ,and add that number to i.Note that 
we must compute modulo(j-i+1) because the number j-i should be included.
srandom(time(NULL));
int ran = random()%(j-i+1);
int num = i+ran;
printf("%d\n",num);
