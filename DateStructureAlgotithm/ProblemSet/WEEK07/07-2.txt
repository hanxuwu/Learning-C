(Boyer-Moore algorithm)
Use your answer to Exercise 1 to write a C-program that:

prompts the user to input
an alphabet (a string),
a text (a string),
a pattern (a string);
computes and outputs the last-occurrence function for the pattern and alphabet;
uses the Boyer-Moore algorithm to match the pattern against the text.
An example of the program executing could be
