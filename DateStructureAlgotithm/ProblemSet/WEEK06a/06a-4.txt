(Insertion at root)
Consider an initially empty BST and the sequence of values

1 2 3 4 5 6
Show the tree resulting from inserting these values "at leaf". What is its height?
Show the tree resulting from inserting these values "at root". What is its height?
Show the tree resulting from alternating between at-leaf-insertion and at-root-insertion. What is its height?
Complete the Binary Search Tree ADT (BSTree.h, BSTree.c) from the lecture by an implementation of the function:

Tree insertAtRoot(Tree t, Item it) { ... }
We have created a script that can automatically test your program. To run this test you can execute the dryrun program that corresponds to the problem set and week. It expects to find a file named BSTree.c in the current directory. You can use dryrun as follows:

~cs9024/bin/dryrun prob06a
Note: The dryrun script expects your program to include your implementation for Exercise 1.b.


Tree insertAtRoot(Tree t,Item it){
    if(t==NULL){
        t=newNode(it);
    }else if(it<data(t)){
        left(t)= insertAtRoot(left(t),it);
        t = rotateRight;
    }else if(it>data(t)){
        right(t) = insertAtRoot(right(t),it);
        t =rotateLeft(t);
    }
    return t;
