3.(MST â€“ Prim's algorithm)
Trace the execution of Prim's algorithm to compute a minimum spanning tree on the following graph:


Choose a random vertex to start with. Draw the resulting minimum spanning tree.  


Solution

If we choose vertex 5:

5:     (0,3,4)
5,3:   (0,4)
5,3,4: (0,7,6)
5,3,4,7:(0,1,6)
5,3,4,7,1(0,6)
5,3,4,7,1,6(0)
5,3,4,7,1,6,0,(2)
