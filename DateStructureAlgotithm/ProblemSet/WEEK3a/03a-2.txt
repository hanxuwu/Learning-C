2.(Graph representations)

a.adjacency matrix representation(V*V matrix with each edge represented twice)

    nV =6
    nE =6
    edges*

    [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
[0]      1   1
[1]  1           1
[2]  1           1   1
[3]      1   1
[4]          1           1  
[5]                  1

b.an adjacency list representation(where each edge appears in two lists,one for v and one for w)

    nV = 6
    nE = 6
    edges*

    *->1->2
    *->0->3
    *->0->3
    *->1->2
    *->2->5
    *->4
