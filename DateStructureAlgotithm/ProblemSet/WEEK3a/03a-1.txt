a.path:
    smallest: any path with one edge (eg:a-b)
    largest: somepath include all nodes(eg:m-g-h-k-i-j-a-b-c-d-e-f)


b.cycle:
     smallest: need at least 3 node (eg:h-k-i)
     largest:g-h-k-i-j-a-b-c-d-e-f-g  (can't involve m)


c:spanning tree
    smallest: including all nodes
    largest : same

d:vertex degree

    smallest: there is a node that has degree 1(vertex m)
    largest: in this graph 5 (b and f)


e:clique
     smallestï¼š any vertex by itself is a clique of size 1;
     largest : this graph has a clique of size 5(Nodes b,c,d,e,f)
